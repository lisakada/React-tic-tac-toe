# React-Tic-Tac-Toe

## Before We Start the Tutorial

We will build a small game. You might be tempted to skip it because you’re not building games — but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React app, and mastering it will give you a deep understanding of React.


The tutorial is divided into several sections:

  - Setup for the Tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.
  - Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.
  - Completing the Game will teach you the most common techniques in React development.
  - Adding Time Travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.


## What Are We Building?

In this tutorial, we’ll build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

You can see what we’ll be building here: [Final Result](https://codepen.io/drbealman/pen/xxXBJoP). If the code doesn’t make sense, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.

We recommend you check out the [tic-tac-toe game](https://codepen.io/drbealman/pen/xxXBJoP) before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features you’ll notice is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. 
  - This list gives a history of all of the moves which have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.

Close the tic-tac-toe game once you’re familiar with it. 
  - We’ll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial. 

 
Our next step is to set up so you can start building the game.

## Prerequisites

We’ll assume you have some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript, but you should be able to follow along even if you’re coming from a different programming language. We’ll also assume you’re familiar with programming concepts like functions, objects, arrays, and to a lesser extent, classes.

If you need to review JavaScript, we recommend reading [this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript). 

**Note** We’re also using some features from ES6 — a recent version of JavaScript. 
  - In this tutorial, we’re using ```arrow``` functions, ```classes```, ```let```, and ```const``` statements. 
  - You can use the [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?presets=react&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBApgGzgWzmWBeGAeAFgRgD4AJRBEAGhgHcQAnBAEwEJsB6AwgbgChRJY_KAEMAlmDh0YWRiGABXVOgB0AczhQAokiVQAQgE8AkowAUAcjogQUcwEpeAJTjDgUACIB5ALLK6aRklTRBQ0KCohMQk6Bx4gA) to check what ES6 code compiles to.
